# Projectile Motion Simulation with Pygame ðŸš€
This project is a simple simulation of projectile motion implemented using Pygame. It allows users to interactively adjust the launch angle and initial velocity of a projectile and visualize its trajectory on the screen.

## Features

- Users can adjust the launch angle of the projectile by moving the mouse cursor.
- Users can adjust the initial velocity of the projectile by moving the mouse on the screen.
- Realistic projectile motion simulation based on physics principles.
- Visualization of the trajectory of the projectile.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/pestopasta74/projectile-motion-simulation.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the simulation script:

```
python main.py
```

2. Interact with the simulation using the mouse:
   - Move the mouse to adjust the launch angle.
   - Move the mouse to change the input velocity.
   - Click the mouse to launch a projectile

3. Observe the trajectory of the projectile and the projectile on the screen.
